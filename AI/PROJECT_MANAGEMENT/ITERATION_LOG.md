# ITERATION_LOG.md

A systematic approach for tracking development decisions, lessons learned, and project evolution to accelerate future iterations and avoid repeated mistakes.

## Purpose

This log serves as a knowledge repository that:
- **Preserves decision context**: Why choices were made, not just what was done
- **Documents lessons learned**: What worked well and what should be avoided
- **Accelerates future development**: Enables rapid progression to proven solutions
- **Prevents regression**: Avoids repeating failed approaches or abandoned experiments

## Example Log Entries

### Technical Decision Example
```markdown
## 2024-03-15 - CMake FetchContent vs Git Submodules

### Context
- **Objective**: Choose dependency management approach for C++ project
- **Environment**: Cross-platform development (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Starting point**: Manual dependency management causing build issues

### Approach
- **Strategy**: Evaluated CMake FetchContent vs Git Submodules vs package managers
- **Rationale**: Needed reproducible builds with pinned versions
- **Implementation**: Created test projects with each approach

### Results
- **Outcome**: FetchContent provided best balance of control and simplicity
- **Success metrics**: Build time, setup complexity, version control integration
- **Unexpected findings**: FetchContent cache significantly improves rebuild times

### Lessons Learned
- **What worked**: FetchContent with pinned tags for reproducible builds
- **What didn't work**: Git submodules too complex for simple dependencies
- **Would do differently**: Set up FetchContent cache from the beginning
- **Key insights**: Modern CMake features eliminate need for complex dependency management

### Future Recommendations
- **Next steps**: Document FetchContent patterns in BUILD_SYSTEM.md
- **Alternatives to explore**: Conan package manager for larger projects
- **Avoid**: Manual dependency management, unpinned versions
- **Prerequisites**: CMake 3.10+ required for FetchContent
```

### Process Improvement Example
```markdown
## 2024-03-20 - AI Pair Programming Effectiveness

### Context
- **Objective**: Improve development velocity with AI assistance
- **Environment**: Complex C++ codebase with performance requirements
- **Starting point**: Traditional solo development approach

### Approach
- **Strategy**: Structured interaction patterns with AI coding assistant
- **Rationale**: Hypothesis that AI could accelerate routine tasks
- **Implementation**: Defined workflows for different types of development tasks

### Results
- **Outcome**: 40% faster for routine implementations, slower for complex algorithms
- **Success metrics**: Time to complete features, code quality metrics
- **Unexpected findings**: AI excellent for boilerplate, documentation, and test generation

### Lessons Learned
- **What worked**: 
  - AI for test case generation and edge case identification
  - Structured prompts with clear context and requirements
  - Iterative refinement of AI-generated code
- **What didn't work**:
  - AI for complex algorithmic logic without human guidance
  - Accepting AI suggestions without understanding the reasoning
- **Would do differently**: Start with AI for documentation and tests, not core logic
- **Key insights**: AI is a powerful accelerator but requires thoughtful integration

### Future Recommendations
- **Next steps**: Develop AI interaction guidelines for team use
- **Alternatives to explore**: Different AI models for specialized tasks
- **Avoid**: Blind acceptance of AI-generated complex logic
- **Prerequisites**: Clear understanding of codebase before engaging AI assistance
```

## Maintenance Practices

### Regular Review Process
- **Weekly reviews**: Scan recent entries for patterns and insights

- **Quarterly planning**: Use log insights to inform future development priorities

### Cross-Reference Integration
- **Link to code**: Reference specific commits, files, or functions
- **Connect to documentation**: Update relevant .md files with insights
- **Tag relationships**: Mark related entries for easy pattern identification
- **Version correlation**: Tie entries to specific project versions or releases

### Knowledge Extraction
- **Pattern identification**: Look for recurring challenges and solutions
- **Best practice codification**: Transform successful approaches into templates
- **Anti-pattern documentation**: Record what to avoid and why
- **Decision framework development**: Create guidelines for future similar decisions
